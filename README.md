Notes-app allows the user to write and store notes that are accessible with the user's credentials. The project contains two web interfaces, and a Node.js server that is used to handle requests between the interfaces and a MongoDB database. The first interface was created with HTML/JavaScript and the second one with React. Both have the same functionality, and either of them can be used. For the use of this project, a connection string for a MongoDB database is required, and it is not provided in the project.
